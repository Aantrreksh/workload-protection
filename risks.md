# Risks and attack path analysis
{: #risks}

{{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_full}} gathers security information from multiple product areas such as posture, vulnerabilities, runtime events and identity, but these findings don't exist in silos.

The Risks module consolidates all findings from the Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) areas and an attack path analysis to help you understand and prioritize the greatest risks detected in your multi-cloud environment. 

Based on the findings of your infrastructure, risks are periodically re-evaluated and re-prioritized to provide a constantly updated report on your current risk factors, enriched with context from {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}}'s runtime agents and detections.

{{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}} implements Sysdig Secure functionality. Information that is provided by the Sysdig Secure documentation applies to Workload Protection as well.
