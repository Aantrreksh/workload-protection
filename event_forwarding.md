# Event forwarding
{: #event_forwarding}

{{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_full}} supports sending different types of security data to third-party SIEM (security information and event management) platforms and logging tools, such as Splunk, Elastic Stack, Qradar, and Arcsight. Use Event Forwarding to integrate with these platforms and logging tools so you can view security events and correlate {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}} findings with the tool that you are already using for analysis.
