# Kubernetes audit logging with admission controller
{: #audit_logging}

Kubernetes log integration enables {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_full}} to use Kubernetes audit log data for Falco Rules and activity auditing. Integration allows auditing of the creation and destruction of pods, services, deployments, and daemon sets. Creating, updating, and removing config maps or secrets and attempts to subscribe to changes to any endpoint are also monitored.
